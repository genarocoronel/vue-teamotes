### FAQ
**Why is it called teamotes?**

The app originally was meant for MS Teams, since they [haven't added them since 2016](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16934329-allow-adding-custom-emoji-memes-gifs-reactions).

**Why can't I use gifs?**

Due to current technical limitations, GIFs cannot be copied and pasted in places. We maybe working on a drag and drop feature to enable this.
